# Q&A
Q: Why some of your commits are unverified?
A: I have lost the keys, which I used them to sign commits with my proton mail. Also, I no longer use proton as my mail service because it costs money to use IMAP/SMTP features.

Q: Earlier, you said "GITHUB SUCKS" and you've been using [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mkoushan) and [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~mkoushan), what happened?
A: Sadly, Iran's government blocked the access to Codeberg, thus I switched to GitHub because it's less likely for it to get blocked. I still have my SourceHut account btw.

Q: Where can I find your resume?
A: [Here](https://mkoushan.github.io/mkoushan/RESUME)
